In this blog, we will explore some best practices for building maintainable Blazor apps. We will discuss how to structure your app, how to manage state, and how to handle errors.
By following these best practices, you can build an app that is easier to maintain and more robust.

## App Structure
The app or project structure is the arrangement of files, folders and projects in your solution. Sometimes these arrangements can be done to depict the architecture of the application but they are not always the same thing.

A typical application consists of a client-side, a server side, a database and an API.

App structure refers to the projects and folders in your solution. Whilst application structure and architecture are different, the lines between are often blurred as applications are structured in a way that depicts the application architecture. 

There are a few types of application architectures that your app structure should depict

### Layered Architecture

In a layered architecture, different components of the application are arranged in layers. 

Most layered architectures consist of four standard layers: presentation, business, persistence, and database

At the buttom is the database layer, which talks directly to the database. 

The persistence logic layer sits on top of the database layer and performs interactions with the database such as CRUD. As a result, it is sometimes called the data access layer or the repository layer because it uses the repository pattern to abstract the implementation of the business logic. 

The business layer is responsible for executing specific business rules associated with the request related to accomplishing functional requirements.

In some cases, the business layer and persistence layer are combined into a single business layer, particularly when the persistence logic is embedded within the business layer components.

One of the powerful features of the layered architecture pattern is the separation of concerns among components. Components within a specific layer deal only with logic that pertains to that layer.

Each layer in marked as closed a closed layer. This means that a request originating from the presentation layer must first go through the business layer and then to the persistence layer before finally hitting the database layer. 

This type of component classification makes it easy to build effective roles and responsibility models into your architecture, and also makes it easy to develop, test, govern, and maintain applications using this architecture pattern due to well-defined component interfaces and limited component scope.

Although the layered architecture pattern does not specify the number and types of layers that must exist in the pattern, it is very common to see 3 or 4 layers in a typical application.

However, there are other variations of the layered architecture such as the N-tier architecture and the 4+1 Krueger Architecture which takes this a step further. 

### Onion Architecture
Unlike the rectangular nature of the layered, the onion architecture is shaped in an onion mimic, with several layers underneath. The onion architecture is used to implement Domain Driven Design or Command Query Responsibility Seperation.



## State Management In Blazor Applications

State management is an important part of any application, but it can be especially challenging in single-page applications (SPAs) like Blazor apps.

Blazor as a framework is composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. These components handle user events and can be nested to build complex user interfaces.

This means that each component can have its own state, which can be managed independently from the rest of the application.

There are many different ways to manage state in Blazor apps. We will explore some of the most common approaches and discuss the pros and cons of each and how to choose the right approach for your specific needs.
