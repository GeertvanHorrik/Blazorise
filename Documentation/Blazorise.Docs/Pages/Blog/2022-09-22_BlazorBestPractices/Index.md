In this blog, we will explore some best practices for building maintainable Blazor apps. We will discuss how to structure your app, how to manage state, and how to handle errors.
By following these best practices, you can build an app that is easier to maintain and more robust.

## App Structure
The app or project structure is the arrangement of files, folders and projects in your solution. Sometimes these arrangements can be done to depict the architecture of the application but they are not always the same thing.

A typical application consists of a client-side, a server side, a database and an API.

App structure refers to the projects and folders in the solution. Whilst application structure and architecture are different, the lines between are often blurred as applications are structured in a way that depicts the application architecture. 




Blazor is a new framework for building interactive web UIs using .NET. Blazor apps are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. These components handle user events and can be nested to build complex user interfaces.

State management is an important part of any application, but it can be especially challenging in single-page applications (SPAs) like Blazor apps.


State management is one of the most important aspects of any application, and it is especially important in applications that are built using web technologies.

Blazor as a web framework allows developers to build interactive web applications using C# and .NET and uses a component-based architecture.

Because Blazor uses these technologies, it is subject to the same state management issues as any other web application.

This means that each component can have its own state, which can be managed independently from the rest of the application.

There are many different ways to manage state in Blazor apps. We will explore some of the most common approaches and discuss the pros and cons of each and how to choose the right approach for your specific needs.
