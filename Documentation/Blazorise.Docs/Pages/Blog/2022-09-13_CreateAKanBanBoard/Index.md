Blazorise as a component library helps to create functionality that enhances user experience. In this short demo, we will demonstrate how Blazorise components can help you program drag-and-drop functionality into your applications in just a few lines of code. 

## Prerequisites
To complete this demo successfully, here are a few prerequisites

- Integrated Development Environment such as Visual Studio or Rider
- The .NET 6 SDK

## Assumptions
As a blog made for developers of various experiences, we want to assume that a reader has  
- Some knowledge of C#
- Knowledge of HTML, CSS
- Knowledge of the .NET ecosystem in the context of web development
- Knowledge of Blazor and its underlying concepts

## Setup
To get started, create a new [Blazor application](/blog/create-a-blazor-application). Blazor is a framework that allows you to build cross-platform client-side and server-side applications. For the purpose of the demo, we will create a [Blazor WebAssembly Application](https://blazorise.com/blog/what-is-blazor-wasm). 

The drag-and-drop functionality of our web application will be demonstrated using [Blazorise Components](https://blazorise.com/docs/components/dragdrop).
